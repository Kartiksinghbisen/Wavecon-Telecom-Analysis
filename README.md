## Business Terminologies

1. **Revenue**: Revenue refers to the total income generated by a business from its normal business activities, such as sales of goods or services. It is typically calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price at which they were sold.
   
2. **Average Revenue per User (ARPU):** Average Revenue per User (ARPU) is a key performance indicator used in businesses that offer subscription-based services, such as telecommunications or software companies. It measures the average revenue generated per user over a specific period, usually monthly or annually. ARPU is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by the total number of users.
   
3. **Total Unsubscribed Users**: Total Unsubscribed Users refers to the number of users who have opted out or cancelled their subscription or service. In a telecommunications context, it could represent customers who have discontinued their mobile phone plans or internet services.
   
4. **Total Active Users**: Total Active Users refers to the total number of users who are actively using a product or service within a specified period. In the context of a telecommunications company, it could represent the total number of customers who are actively using their mobile phone plans, internet services, or other offerings.
